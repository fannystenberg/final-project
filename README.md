# Final Project

The idea:
Application you save your favorite locations / places in one place.
It’s main purpose is to add, list, edit and delete places. You create your own account and log in to save your list to your profile.
The user is able to create their own list of locations with the possibility to check off if it’s been visited or not.

Frontend should include:
- React
- Navigation using React Router
- Redux
- Styled components / UI library

MVP:
- Location feed
- Add/edit/delete location
- User profile (individual location list)

Stretch goals:
- Tags that can be filtered
- Filter for visited / not visited
- API from google maps
